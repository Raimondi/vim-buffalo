Help on using the buffalo                                               *buffalo*

 1. INTRODUCTION                                                  *buffalo-intro*

The Buffalo is a minimalist buffer switcher. When activated, it displays a
coloured buffer list and prompts for either a buffer number of partial buffer
name. As soon as either is sufficient to uniquely identify a single file in
the list it is automatically switched to, closing the buffalo interface.

The default trigger for activating the buffalo is |<leader>|l but this can be
changed by providing a map in |$MYVIMRC| to <plug>BuffaloTrigger, like so:
>
  nmap <unique><silent> <leader>b <Plug>BuffaloTrigger
<
to map it instead to <leader>b.

 2. CONFIGURATION                                         *buffalo-configuration*

The following aspects of the buffalo's behaviour are configurable with entries
like:
>
  let buffalo_autoaccept = 0
<
in your |$MYVIMRC|.

Options:~

'buffalo_aux_map'		Internal trigger. Only set this if the default
				map of <C-G> clashes with another plugin or a
				personal map of your making.
				(String: <C-G>)

'buffalo_autoaccept'		Automatically switch buffers when the
				partially typed characters uniquely match a
				single buffer. With this option disabled, you
				have to press <Enter> manually to activate the
				buffer switch.
				(Boolean: enabled)

'buffalo_pretty'		Shows the buffer list in colour.
				(Boolean: enabled)

'buffalo_buffer_numbers'	Allows for the switching of buffers based on
				buffer numbers (in addition to partial buffer
				names). With this disabled, only numbers within
				buffer names are considered for matches.
				(Boolean: enabled)

Maps:~

Override the defaults shown here by providing maps in |$MYVIMRC| like so:
>
  nmap <unique><silent> <leader>b <Plug>BuffaloTrigger
<

<Plug>BuffaloRecursive		Internal trigger, mapped to <C-G> by default.
				This can either be altered through the
				'buffalo_aux_map' variable or through a
				<plug> map in your |$MYVIMRC|.

<Plug>BuffaloTrigger		Buffalo activation trigger, mapped to <leader>l
				by default.
