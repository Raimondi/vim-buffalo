The Buffalo
-----------

NOTE: The buffalo requires Vim 7.3 with patch 338 to perform its magic.

NOTE: The buffalo depends on https://github.com/dahu/vimple

The buffalo is a minimalist buffer switcher for Vim. Based on the
principle that flying is faster than cycling, we believe that you
should not be using :bprev and :bnext (even bound to handy keys)
because that is slower than using the builtin Vim buffer list (:ls)
and buffer switcher (:b). The builtin :b command can switch to a
buffer by number or by partial buffer name match. It even supports
fuzzy matching.

The buffalo uses Vim's ctrl-d command to show partial matches as well
as the :b command to automatically switch when a single unique buffer
name matches the typed partial - without the user needing to press
<Enter>.

If you know your buffer number, you can still switch by buffer number
using the buffalo.
